# Week 1
Trigonometry- a branch of geometry looking at triangles and the relation of thier sides and angles

Prerequiste Info Review - inequality notation

Graph   $-2 \le x < 5$   
+ [ $^{-2} $-- $^{0} $----- $^{5}$)   
<br>

## 1.1 Interval Notation
"The Set Of All X Such That"   
Ex 1: $-2 \le x < 5$ Would Become ${x|-2 \le x<5}$   
_____________
In Set Builder Notation The Smaller Number Goes To The Left   
Infinity ($\infty$) Will Always Be Non Inclusive  
 $\le$ & $\ge$ Are Inclusive Whereas ( & ) Are Non Inclusive
 If Something is Inclusive Use [] Whereas When its Non Inclusive Use ( )
 Three Combinations Of The Two 
 + (Open Interval) 
 + [Closed Interval]
 + (Half Open]   

### Ex 2:    
 {x|x2 $\ge$-2} <-- This Is Setbuilder
 [-2, $\infty$) <--- This is interval, you translate the setbuilder into this
 Then the graph for [-2, $\infty$)
 + $^{-2}$----->
 in the graph above no points as it goes on forever
