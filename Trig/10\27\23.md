# 1. Sine Function (y = sin(x)):

> * Period: The sine function has a period of 2π (360 degrees). This means it repeats every 2π units.
> *  Starting Point (Begging of the First Period): The sine function starts at (0, 0).
> * Cheat Code: Remember the "cheat code" 0, 1, 0, -1, 0 for y-values within the first quadrant.
> * Default Period Length (PL): 2π
> * Period Length Formula: PL = 2π/b, where 'b' is the coefficient of x.
> * Domain: The domain is all real numbers (−∞, ∞).
> * Range: The range is between -1 and 1, inclusive. [-1, 1]
> * X-Intercepts: The x-intercepts occur at kπ, where k is an integer. In other words, the x-intercepts are at x = 0, π, 2π, -π, -2π, etc.

> * Period: The cosecant function has the same period as the sine function, 2π (360 degrees).

> * Period: The cotangent function has the same period as the tangent function, π (180 degrees).

> * Default Period Length (PL): π
> * Period Length Formula: PL = π/b, where 'b' is the coefficient of x.
> * Domain: The domain excludes values where the denominator is zero, so it's (-∞, ∞) with the excluded values at x = nπ, where n is an integer.
