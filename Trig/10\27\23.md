# 1. Sine Function (y = sin(x)):

> * Period: The sine function has a period of 2π (360 degrees). This means it repeats every 2π units.
> *  Starting Point (Begging of the First Period): The sine function starts at (0, 0).
> * Cheat Code: Remember the "cheat code" 0, 1, 0, -1, 0 for y-values within the first quadrant.
> * Default Period Length (PL): 2π
> * Period Length Formula: PL = 2π/b, where 'b' is the coefficient of x.
> * Domain: The domain is all real numbers (−∞, ∞).
> * Range: The range is between -1 and 1, inclusive. [-1, 1]
> * X-Intercepts: The x-intercepts occur at everytime the graph passes through X axis, answer with setbuilder notation

# 3. Tangent Function (y = tan(x)):

> * Period: The tangent function has a period of π (180 degrees). This means it repeats every π units.
> * Starting Point (Begging of the First Period): The tangent function starts at (0, 0).
> * Cheat Code: No cheat code needed for tangent; it's positive in the first quadrant.
> * Default Period Length (PL): π
> * Period Length Formula: PL = π/b, where 'b' is the coefficient of x.
> * Domain: The domain excludes values where the denominator is zero, so it's (-∞, ∞) with the excluded values at x = (2n + 1)π/2, where n is an integer.
> * Range: The range is all real numbers, from negative infinity to positive infinity (-∞, ∞).
> * X-Intercepts: The x-intercepts occur at kπ, where k is an integer. In other words, the x-intercepts are at x = 0, π, -π, 2π, -2π, etc.

# 4. Cosecant Function (y = csc(x)):

> * Period: The cosecant function has the same period as the sine function, 2π (360 degrees).
> * Starting Point (Begging of the First Period): The cosecant function starts at (0, undefined) because it has vertical asymptotes at the x-intercepts of the sine function.
> * Cheat Code: Use the "cheat code" 0, 1, 0, -1, 0 for y-values within the first quadrant.
> * Default Period Length (PL): 2π
> * Period Length Formula: PL = 2π/b, where 'b' is the coefficient of x.
> * Domain: The domain is all real numbers except for the x-values that make the sine function equal to zero. So, the domain is x ≠ kπ, where k is an integer.
> * Range: The range is all real numbers, excluding zero, i.e., y ≠ 0.
> * X-Intercepts: The x-intercepts occur at kπ, where k is an integer. In other words, the x-intercepts are at x = 0, π, -π, 2π, -2π, etc.

# 5. Secant Function (y = sec(x)):

> * Period: The secant function has the same period as the cosine function, 2π (360 degrees).
> * Starting Point (Begging of the First Period): The secant function starts at (0, undefined) because it has vertical asymptotes at the x-intercepts of the cosine function.
> * Cheat Code: Use the "cheat code" 1, 0, -1, 0, 1 for y-values within the first quadrant.
> * Default Period Length (PL): 2π
> * Period Length Formula: PL = 2π/b, where 'b' is the coefficient of x.
> * Domain: The domain is all real numbers except for the x-values that make the cosine function equal to zero. So, the domain is x ≠ (k + 1/2)π, where k is an integer.
> * Range: The range is all real numbers, excluding values between -1 and 1.
> * X-Intercepts: The x-intercepts occur at (k + 1/2)π, where k is an integer. In other words, the x-intercepts are at x = π/2, -π/2, 3π/2, -3π/2, etc.

# 6. Cotangent Function (y = cot(x)):

> * Period: The cotangent function has the same period as the tangent function, π (180 degrees).
> * Starting Point (Begging of the First Period): The cotangent function starts at (0, undefined) because it has vertical asymptotes at the x-intercepts of the tangent function.
