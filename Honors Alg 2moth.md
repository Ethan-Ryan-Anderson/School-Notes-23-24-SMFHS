# Logs and exponetial grow and decay
# Intrest
### Exponetial growth formula <br>
### $y=a(1+r)^t$, A represents your deposit/starting value, R is the percent of increase as a decimal and T is the amount of years <br>
> [!NOTE]
> The formula is the same for exponetial decay except its 1-r not 1+r.
##### Compounded Intrest
### Compounded Intest formula <br>
### $a = p (1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$
### Where P = the deposit, R is the rate/percent, T is time (in years), and N is the amount of times compounded in one year
# Natural Base E
### $e^3 * e^6 = e^9$ <br>
### $\frac{16e^5}{4e^4}$, do $16 \div 4$ to get 4 then subtract e exponetes to get 4e <br>
### $(3e^{-4x})^2$, distrubte the outer $^2$ to get $3^2$ and $(e^{-4x})^2$ and since its $^({-4x})^2$ you multiple the exoponets getting $e^{-8x}$ having a final solution of $9e^{-8x}$ BUT you need to get rid of the negitave exoponet so you just make a fraction with e^8 on the bottom so the final answer is actually 9/e^8
# Continuously Compounded Intrest
### $A = Pe^{rt}$
### p is the intial investment, e is just the e number on ur calc, R is the rate and T is time in years
# Logarithms
### We know that $2^2 = 4$ and $2^3 = 8$ but how do we solve $2^x = 6$
### Forms of logs, there is logarithmic form ($Log_{b}Y=x$) and exponet form $b^x=y$
### B is the base, X is the exponet b^x always equals Y
# LN or Logarithms in base E
### thats it tbh Ln is just a log in base E
