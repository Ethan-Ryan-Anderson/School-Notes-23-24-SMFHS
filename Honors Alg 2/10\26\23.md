how to solve this 4x^2<25

Subtract 25 from both sides of the inequality:

4x^2 - 25 < 0

Factor the left side of the inequality:

Recognize that 4x^2 - 25 can be written as (2x)^2 - 5^2, which is in the form of the difference of squares.

Apply the difference of squares formula, which states that a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b). In this case, a is 2x, and b is 5.

Use the formula to factor 4x^2 - 25:

4x^2 - 25 = (2x + 5)(2x - 5)

So, the expression 4x^2 - 25 can be factored as (2x + 5)(2x - 5).

(2x + 5)(2x - 5) < 0

Now, you need to find the values of x that make the expression (2x + 5)(2x - 5) less than 0. To do this, you can use the sign of the factors. The sign changes at the roots of each factor, which are x = -5/2 and x = 5/2.

Create a sign chart with these critical values:

The inequality (2x + 5)(2x - 5) is less than 0 in the intervals where the sign chart shows a negative sign. So, the solution to the inequality is:

x < -5/2 or 5/2 < x

This means that x can be any real number less than -5/2 or greater than 5/2 for the inequality 4x^2 < 25 to be satisfied.

To solve the quadratic inequality x^2 - 11x ≥ -28, you can follow these steps and explain how to factor it along the way:

Start with the quadratic inequality:

x^2 - 11x ≥ -28

Move all terms to one side of the inequality to set it equal to zero:

x^2 - 11x + 28 ≥ 0

To factor this quadratic expression, you need to find two numbers that multiply to the coefficient of x^2 (which is 1) times the constant term (which is 28), and these two numbers must add up to the coefficient of the linear term (which is -11). These numbers are -7 and -4 because (-7) * (-4) = 28, and (-7) + (-4) = -11.

Rewrite the middle term (-11x) using these two numbers as coefficients:

x^2 - 7x - 4x + 28 ≥ 0

Group and factor by grouping:

(x^2 - 7x) - (4x - 28) ≥ 0

Factor each group:

x(x - 7) - 4(x - 7) ≥ 0

Notice that (x - 7) is a common factor:

(x - 7)(x - 4) ≥ 0

You have successfully factored the quadratic expression as (x - 7)(x - 4) ≥ 0. Now, you can proceed to solve the inequality.

To find the solutions to the inequality, consider the critical points where the expression (x - 7)(x - 4) changes sign. These critical points are x = 4 and x = 7. Create a sign chart with these critical values and test intervals as explained in the previous response to determine the solutions to the inequality. The solution is:

x ≤ 4 or x ≥ 7

This means that x can be any real number less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 7 for the inequality x^2 - 11x ≥ -28 to be satisfied.

# Frac(x)^2 numx <> num
Solving the quadratic inequality (1/2)x^2 - x > 4 involves the same general approach as before, but the coefficient of x^2 is different. Let's go through the steps:

Start with the quadratic inequality:

(1/2)x^2 - x > 4

To remove the fraction, you can multiply the entire inequality by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x^2 - 2x > 8

Move all terms to one side of the inequality to set it equal to zero:

x^2 - 2x - 8 > 0

To factor this quadratic expression, you need to find two numbers that multiply to the coefficient of x^2 (which is 1) times the constant term (which is -8), and these two numbers must add up to the coefficient of the linear term (which is -2). These numbers are -4 and 2 because (-4) * (2) = -8, and (-4) + (2) = -2.

Rewrite the middle term (-2x) using these two numbers as coefficients:

x^2 - 4x + 2x - 8 > 0

Group and factor by grouping:

(x^2 - 4x) + (2x - 8) > 0

Factor each group:

x(x - 4) + 2(x - 4) > 0

Notice that (x - 4) is a common factor:

(x - 4)(x + 2) > 0

Now that you've factored the quadratic expression as (x - 4)(x + 2) > 0, you can proceed to solve the inequality.

To find the solutions to the inequality, consider the critical points where the expression (x - 4)(x + 2) changes sign. These critical points are x = -2 and x = 4. Create a sign chart with these critical values and test intervals to determine the solutions to the inequality. The solution is:

x < -2 or x > 4

This means that x can be any real number less than -2 or greater than 4 for the inequality (1/2)x^2 - x > 4 to be satisfied.

## (num ± num(i)) ± (num ± num(i))
To solve the expression (3 - 6i) - (7 + 2i), you are performing complex number subtraction. Follow these steps:

Subtract the real parts (the parts without the "i") and the imaginary parts separately:

Real part: 3 - 7 = -4
Imaginary part: -6i - 2i = -8i

Combine the results from step 1 to form the complex number:

-4 - 8i

So, (3 - 6i) - (7 + 2i) equals -4 - 8i.
