###Objectives, 
###Identify family of functions, describe transformations of parent functions describe combinations of transformations

#Funtion familys 
funtions that share key characteristics, parent function is the most basic function in a family (if all functions are parabolas the parent would be a basic parabola)

#Basic parent functions 
###Constant
 (Technically linear but slope of zero) A Basic flat line with an equation of f(x) = 1

###Linear
Basic sloped linear function with an equation of f(x)=x

###Absolute Value
Look like a  equation of f(x)=|x|

###Quadratic
Parabolas, equation of f(x)=x^2

#Examples
###Ex: 1 Graph g(x) = x-4
###whats the parent function
could be y=x only diffrent becuase of "- 4" so its linear


###hows this function diffrent
Moved down four spaces

#Ex 2: Graph g(x) = X^2 + 2
###Whats the parent function,
Quadratic
###hows the function diffrent
The parabola has been raised two units

#how does adding or subtracting a constant from the outside of an function affect the graph
moves the graph vertically

#EX 3: graph g(x) = |x+1|
###parent function
Absoulute Value
###hows it diffrent
Shifted one to the left due to our constant being inside the function

#Ex 4: graph g(x) = (x-3)^2
###whats the parent
Quadratic
###Hows it diffrent
Moved to the Right 3 spaces

#how does adding or subtracting inside a function affect the graph
moves it left and right, (Adding goes to the left, subtracting is right)

#ex 5 graph g(x) = -x
###what is the parent function
linear
###hows the function diffrent 
flipped over the X axis

#Ex 6 graph g(x) = -x^2
###parent function
quadractic
###hows it diffrent
flipped over x axis

#how does a negitive infront of a function affect the graph
flips the graph over the x axis

#Ex 7 graph g(x) 2|x|
###whats the parent function
Absolute value
###hows it diffrent
steeper slopes on the V shape (stretched vertically)

#Ex 8 graph g(x) = 1/2x^2
###whats the parent function
quadratic
###hows it diffrent
it got wider, (squeezed/compressed vertically

#how does a coefficient in front of a function affect the graph what if the numbers larger than 1 or smaller
verticall stretch (bigger than one) or vertical shrink (smaller than one)

#**Major Idea**
##**What do you notice about the changes to the outside of a function opposed to changes inside of a function
###Outside changes
move the graph vertically if you add it will move up subtract it goes down, if you multiply it will stretch vertically, if a negetive is outside it is flipped over the x axis
###Inside changes
inside changes are horizontal if you add its going to go left, so if you multiply it will stretch horizontally, if you get a negative it reflects over the Y axis

#**Combinations of Transforamtions

#Ex 9 grapg g(x) = -|x+5|-3
#Parent function
Absolute Value
#Hows it diffrent
Flipped over x axis, shifted 3 down and 5 the the left

#Ex 10 graph g(x) = -0.25x^2 + 4
###parent function
quadratic
### hows it diffrent
flipped on x axis, vertical shrink by .25 and 4 up
