# 1.2 Transformations Of Linear And Absoulute Value Functions
### Todays Objectives
+  Write functions representing translations and reflections
+  Write functions representing stretches and shrinks
+  Write functions representing combinations of transformations

# Horizontal Translations
### Y = F(x-h)
+ Subtracting H from the inputs before evaluating function shifts the graph left when h greater than zero and right when H is less than zero

# Vertical Translations
### Y = F(x) + K
+ Adding k to the outputs shifts the graph down when k is less than 0 and up when k is greater than zero

# Ex 1: 9x) = 2x + 1
### A)  Write a function g whose graph os a translation 3 units down of the graph of f
+ g(x) = 2x+1-3  *(we are adding the translation onto function of F)*
+ combine like terms to make g(x) = 2x-2

### B) Write a function h whose graph is a translation to units to the left of the graph of f
+h(x) = f(x- -2) ***subtract minus two to from all inputs***
+ h(x) = f(x + 2)
+ h(x)= 2(x+2) + 1
+ add the like terms
+ =2x+4+1
+ h(x)=2x+5

# Reflections in the X Axis
### Y = -f (x)
+ Multiplying the outputs by - 1 changes thier signs

# Reflections in the Y Axis
### y = f(-x)
+ multiplying the inputs by -1 changes thier signs

#Ex 2: F(x) = |x+3| + 1
### A) Write a function g whose graph is a reflection in the x axis of the graph of f
+ g(x) = -|x+3|+1
+  ***distribute the negetive to the +1***
+  g(x) = -|x+3|-1

### B) Write function h whose graph is a reflection in the  axis of the graph of F
+ H(x) = f(-x)
+ ***make all "x's" negetive***
+ h(x) = |-x+3| + 1 <-- This is right but teacher is a retard and wants to over complicate things
+ "i dont like that negetive being in there, so factor a negetive out of the || brackets
+ = |-1| |x-3| + 1 *** the |-1| came from the factoring
+ H(x) 1 |x-3| + 1 *** get the pos one becuase its the absolute value of -1
+ h(x)= |x-3| + 1 ***in the end teacher ends up translating to make the reflection instead of reflecting***

# Horizontal Stretch/Shrink
### y = f(ax)
+multiplying the inputs by A before evaluating stretches the graph horizontally (away from y axis) when A is greater than 1 and shrinks when less than one

#Vertical Stretches/shrinks
### y = a[f(X)]
+multiplying the outputs by A stretches the graph vertically (away from x axis) when a is greater than one and shrinks the a is less than one

#Ex 3: f(x) = |x-3| - 5
### A) Write a function g whose graph is a horizontal shrink of the graph f by 1/3
+***multiply x by 3***
+g(x)= |3x-3|-5

### B) Write a function of h whose graph is a vertical stretch of the graph of f by a factor of 2
+ h(x) = 2|x-3| - 10 ***multiply the outside by stretch factor***

#Ex 4: Let the graph of G be a vertical shrink by a factor of 0.25 followed by a translation of 3 units up of the graph f(x) = x
+ g(x) = 1/4x + 3
